For the past five or six months, I’ve been thinking deeply about the recent changes happening in the world of AI — what it means for how we work today, and what the future might look like.

PS: If you haven’t paused to reflect on this shift yet, you might be missing something important.

During this time, I’ve been re-evaluating my own style of work and how I can better leverage AI, while also thinking about what my future could look like. I had been meaning to write about these thoughts for months, and finally got inspired to put them into words after [reading this post](https://x.com/mattshumer_/status/2021256989876109403) by Matt Shumer.

This article is essentially a collection of those reflections.

## AI Anxiety

Let’s begin with a term I recently saw somewhere on the socials — **AI anxiety**.

It’s obvious why people feel anxious about AI. When something is being developed that can potentially do exactly what you do for a living — and possibly do it better — fear is a natural reaction. Interestingly, I don’t personally feel that anxiety, and I spent some time asking myself why.

I think it comes down to how I define who I am. I don’t see myself strictly as a developer or tied to a single profession. I see myself as a **Builder** — someone who currently builds software, but isn’t limited to it. I equally enjoy creating art pieces, designing in-person experiences, woodworking, making music, and many other forms of creation.

Even if software development eventually becomes something AI can fully handle, it wouldn’t feel like the end of what I do. I would simply build something else. And that feels completely fine.

In a way, passions should be diversified just like an investment portfolio. You don’t want a single failed investment to collapse your entire portfolio, and similarly, you don’t want one skill or passion becoming obsolete to bring down your entire career.

Diversify.

## A Paradigm Shift: Personal Software

Software is what I spend most of my time building, and a major shift is already underway.

We are writing significantly less code today. With the latest AI models, in many cases you can avoid writing code entirely. You can simply describe the software you want in a few sentences, and the model can generate a working implementation. And this capability is improving every day.

This leads to an important question:
**If everyone can create software for themselves, will people continue buying software made by others?**

I suspect the answer is increasingly no.

Soon, individuals may be able to simply describe what they need and receive polished, robust software tailored specifically to them. One common counter-argument is that people will still value “taste” — beautiful design and thoughtful craftsmanship created by humans.

But from what I’ve seen, AI models are already beginning to demonstrate what we traditionally call taste. And given the exponential pace of progress in AI, it may not be long before AI closely replicates the aesthetic judgment we associate with human designers today.

What I believe will happen is this: powerful AI systems will build highly reliable personal software for each individual. Software will become so trustworthy and personalized that traditional visual interfaces may become less important. Instead of navigating apps, you might simply speak or write what you want done and receive the result — likely through a simple conversational interface.

And when the interface itself starts disappearing, the importance of visual taste may diminish as well.

## What Will Matter: Experiences and Human Interaction

If software becomes personal and infinitely customizable, does that mean people will stop building software for others?

I don’t think so.

There will still be software that people use together — software that cannot be reduced to simple CRUD functionality. These will be **shared experiences**.

Even if AI can build perfectly tailored software for an individual, it cannot easily recreate the experience of thousands of people participating together in something meaningful. As the world becomes increasingly digital and potentially more isolated, people will seek experiences they can share with others — both online and in person.

Human interaction itself becomes the value.

## CSSBattle

This belief strongly connects to CSSBattle.

CSSBattle isn’t special because of its technology or gameplay mechanics alone. It is what it is because of its players. The real value comes from the experience of competing in real time alongside other human developers.

Earlier, I mentioned a future where people may not need to write code manually anymore. Yet I believe there will always be passionate programmers — people like me — who can get work done with AI but still feel something missing when they no longer write code by hand. Not because they can’t, but because the future simply doesn’t require it.

When that happens, CSSBattle can become a place where developers come to chill, write code, compete with other humans, and enjoy the craft itself.

That’s why I believe CSSBattle will be incredibly valuable in the future. I’m very bullish on it, and I’m not giving up on it anytime soon.

## Physical Products and Experiences

This year, my direction isn’t limited to CSSBattle or software alone.

I want to move more deeply into physical products and real-world experiences. My plans include organizing in-person CSSBattle conferences, building a clothing line inspired by ancient Vedic heritage, and creating a calm, serene café of my own — among other ideas.

## Conclusion

To summarize: I’m genuinely excited about the future and the possibilities that AI has unlocked.

Rather than seeing AI as something that replaces what we do, I see it as something that reshapes where we direct our creativity and energy.

And I look forward to seeing you at one of the experiences I launch soon.
